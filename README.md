# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description

This is a Rock Paper Scissors game project created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the development tool used is Visual Studio Code.

The main functionality of the game is to play rounds of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. A winner is declared after 5 consecutive rounds. The player can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round, and the computer's choice is randomly generated. The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores, and the first player to reach 5 points is declared the winner.
